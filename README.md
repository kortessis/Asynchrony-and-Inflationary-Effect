# Asynchrony and Inflationary Effect
 Code to model spatio-temporal dynamics and the influence of asynchrony on population growth and persistence. This repository contains examples from different models. All the code and figures are produced in Matlab.

The code is separated into four folders for different models. 

Code to simulate the finite patch Levins metapopulation model can be found in the "Metapopulations" folder. There you will find the code to reproduce figures 2 and 3 of the main text and the code associated with the reaction norm approach described in the supplement. 

Code to simulate the source-sink model can be found in the folder "TwoPatch Model". There you will find the code to reproduce figure 4.

Code to simulate the SIR model for a respiratory disease, including the deterministic and stochastic forms, are in the folder titled "SIR-Model". 

Code to recreate figure 1 and to do the variance partitioning are in the folder "Variance-Partitioning"
